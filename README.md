# Order of updates in Monte Carlo computations of quantum fields

The order of updates, in Monte Carlo computations of quantum fields, has been found to have
an impact on the accuracy of the correlation function; this impact is dependent on the temperature
given to the system. The model analysed was the Ising Model. It was assessed in one, two and
three dimensions. New states of the system were produced using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method and the Metropolis algorithm. The states were divided into bins and averaged over them
to reduce the dependence between consecutive states in the chain. The mean correlation function
and its standard deviation over the chain were computed. The order of updates was defined, inter
alia, by the Hilbert and Lebesgue space-filling curves.
